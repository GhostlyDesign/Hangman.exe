# Hangman
Whilst creating the hangman game which was created with Electron, i had came across so many challanges! This assigment was event-driven programming whereby i had to make a chosen game related to the course specification, the programming languages that were used: HTML, CSS, JS within this application.

To get started with this application, you will need to install node.js. 

To install Electron onto the project you will need to do: 

npm i -D electron@latest

You must have node.js installed in-order for this to work.

Commands: 

NPM INSTALL

cd (app folder) 

NPM START

When you have done these it should promt you to the windows application.
